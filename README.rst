About
=====

This package was developed during the course of my graduate studies at UC
Berkeley in the field of condensed matter physics. Its initial purpose was to
serve as a matrix codiagonalization library for the optimized projection
functions approach [1_] to constructing localized Wannier functions.


Requirements
============

- Python 2.7 (compatibility with Python 3 is untested)
- NumPy
- SciPy


Installing
==========

To install, clone the repository and run:

::

   python setup.py install
